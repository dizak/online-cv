career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I started my career as a microbiologist. I spent over 4 years working in the wet lab.
      Then, my interests drifted towards bioinformatics field. I have never attemted any kind of
      formal education in computer science or related topics. I used only freely-available resources, eg
      online tutorials, courses, handbooks and the official documentation.

      Right now, I am at the end of my PhD project at the Department of Bioinformatics at the
      Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Science. I am the author of few open-source projects
      which can be viewed on my [github](https://github.com/dizak/).

      I am interested in further developing my Computer Science-related skills.

        The main goal of the the PhD project is to test whether there is any relation between genetic interactions and phylogenetic profiles.
        This requires integration of different types of data, downloading datasets with available REST APIs and heavy-load processing on a HPC cluster.
        [prowler](https://dizak.github.io/prowler) is a toolkit developed along the project.
        [prowler](https://dizak.github.io/prowler) depends on and integrates with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org).

        [mothulity](https://dizak.github.io/mothulity) is a side-project, which arised from my own needs for saving time and effort in metagenomic analyses.
        [mothulity](https://dizak.github.io/mothulity) is an easy-to-use tool that makes work with [Mothur](https://www.mothur.org/) trivial.
