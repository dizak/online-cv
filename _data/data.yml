    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      In 2015 I have started my PhD research in the at the Department of Bioinformatics at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Science (IBB PAS).


      The core of my PhD project involves Data Mining of large datasets on a daily basis.
      I am a developer of Python libraries and packages.
      I have also created Django- and Flask-based web-services.


      My projects were implemented by myself from design to deployment.
      I am responsible for administrative tasks on a HPC (SLURM) and VPS (Xen) farm.


      Right now, I am at the end of my PhD project.
      I am looking for a job in which I can furtherly develop my programming skills in an agile team.
      My main interests are web-services, especially micro-services.
      I am *nix, Python and containers enthuziast.

        The main goal of my PhD project is to test whether there is any relation between genetic interactions and phylogenetic profiles.
        This requires integration of different types of data, downloading datasets with available REST APIs and heavy-load processing on a HPC cluster.
        [prwlr](https://dizak.github.io/prwlr) is a toolkit developed along the project.
        [prwlr](https://dizak.github.io/prwlr) depends on and integrates with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org).

        [mothulity](https://dizak.github.io/mothulity) is a side-project which arised from my own needs for saving time and effort in metagenomic analyses.
        [mothulity](https://dizak.github.io/mothulity) is an easy-to-use tool that makes work with [Mothur](https://www.mothur.org/) trivial.
        
        My main work environment is Jupiter Notebook. I use it for prototyping, data-processing and demonstrations, such as [this one](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dizak/nb-iris-dashboard/master).
